# Program Description Based Programming

## Introduction

When writing the first of a series of blog posts it is challenging to find the right balance between providing *too many details* or *too few details*. This introduction provides many details. It is perfectly fine to read it diagonally.

Before starting, let's present a bit of history.

### History

In 1977, John Backus was an [ACM A.M. Turing Award](http://amturing.acm.org/) winner. The title of his Turing Award winning lecture was 

*Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style? A functional style and it's algebra of programs.*

This series of blog posts builds upon the ideas of this influential lecture.

### Dotty

In his Turing Award winning lecture, John Backus describes a [*function level programming language* `FP`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FP_%28programming_language). In this series of blog posts, we describe a *program description library* that is written in the [`Dotty` *programming language*](http://dotty.epfl.ch/). The main `trait` of the library is the `Program` *type class* that closely resembles `FP`.
